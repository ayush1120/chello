The internet is very good at amplifying the 'horror stories' because those are the people who post the most.\n\nHowever, I’ve been looking at the actual patient data to see what is most likely to happen. Did you know that on patient forums, the most common thing people report upon waking up is *not* pain, but confusion—because their leg pain is suddenly gone?\n\nIf you knew that was the most likely outcome—waking up and realizing the pain is just... silent—how would that change your feeling about the morning of the surgery?"

Not the scary one, but the image of standing up straight.\n\nDoes focusing on *that* specific story help quiet the noise in your stomach?"

You are in the hospital gown, and they are wheeling you down the hall.\n\nIn that moment, are you thinking about the surgery tools, or are you thinking about that patient walking out straight?"
